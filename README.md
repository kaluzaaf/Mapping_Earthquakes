# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview and Outcome
Our tool allows users to filter by earthquakes, major earthquakes larger than a 4.5, and tectonic plates over a street, satellite and dark view map. The earthquakes are differentiated by size and a gradient color scale ranging from 1 to 5+. This tool will allow the end user a easily searchable data base that will automatically be updated from official United States Geological Surveyâ€™s website.
